ODK is a collection of free and open-source software tools that help people capture mission-critical data in real-time through mobile technology. ODK Skunkworks is a listing of projects that are experimental and not yet released for broad deployment. Learn more about skunkworks projects [on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skunkworks_project).

## Adding new skunkworks projects
Anyone in the ODK community is welcome to propose a skunkworks project! Once developers for the project have been identified, the project can be brought up for discussion at the regular [Technical Steering Committee](https://github.com/getodk/governance/tree/master/TSC-1) meeting. If the project fits into ODK's mission, the new skunkworks project will get a GitHub repository in the [`getodk` organization](https://github.com/getodk) and will be listed in this file.
