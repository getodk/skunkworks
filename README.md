## Adding new skunkworks projects
Anyone in the ODK community is welcome to propose a skunkworks project! Once developers for the project have been identified, the project can be brought up for discussion at the regular [Technical Steering Committee](https://github.com/opendatakit/governance/tree/master/TSC1) meeting. If the project fits into ODK's mission, the new skunkworks project will get a GitHub repository in the [`opendatakit` organization](https://github.com/opendatakit) and will be listed in this file.
